Solid APIs REST-based and built around JSON-encoded requests and responses with standard authentication method, response and error codes.

To get started,
1. Solid team will set you up with a Pre-provisioned Sandbox account.
2. Using the <a href="https://dashboard.sandbox.solidfi.com/login" target="_blank"> Dashboard</a> in the Sandbox environment, you'll create an API key.

You'll need Postman or a similar tool to run the APIs.

<Note>You always start with a Sandbox. Once your FinTech program is ready to be onboarded with the partner bank, you'll receive a pre-provisioned Production access.</Note>

Here are the ten steps we will guide you through. After completing these steps, you will have originated a sub account, created cards and counterparties, made a payment and viewed the transactions.
