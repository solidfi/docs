title: "List NAICS Codes"
description: API to get the list of NAICS codes to be used when creating a business
---
Your program needs to collect a 6-digit NAICS code for every business that is being onboarded . The Business object has a mandatory field - “naicsCode” that must be be set when you Create a Business.

NAICS Codes are used to classify businesses into specific industries. NAICS uses a hierarchical structure and is as follows:

- Sector (2-digit code)
   - Industry Group (4-digit code)
      - National Industry (6-digit code)

**Example**:
- Construction (23 is the NAICS code)
   - Nonresidential Building Construction (2362 is the NAICS code)
      - Industrial Building Construction (236210 is the NAICS code)

If a business is best categorized under Industrial Building Construction, the program should send the NAICS code 236210 in the business create or update endpoint.

#### Please note:

- The response from the get NAICS endpoint will have hundreds of codes; the sample below is just to show the response structure.
-  NAICS code cannot be updated once the business is approved/declined.

```url ENDPOINT
GET /v1/business/naicscode
