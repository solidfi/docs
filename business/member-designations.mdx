title: "Business Member Designations"
description: A list of the possible values for the designation field in the member object
---

The "designation" field in the [business member object](https://www.solidfi.com/docs/the-member-object) is a mandatory field. Each business member must have this field set before [KYB submission](https://www.solidfi.com/docs/submit-a-kyb).

Each business needs to have one control person. The programs can use the [isControlPerson](https://www.solidfi.com/docs/the-member-object) flag in the business member object to set a member as the control person. The programs must explicitly ask through their application if the business member being added is the control person or not. When the program designates a business member as a control person by setting the "isControlPerson" field to true, and a control person already exists, the previously assigned member will no longer be considered a control person, and this flag isControlPerson will be overriden for the previous assigned person.

The control person must have one of the designations from the list below:

- chiefExecutiveOfficer  
- chiefFinancialOfficer  
- chiefOperatingOfficer  
- chiefLegalOfficer  
- generalCounsel  
- managingMember  
- member  
- generalPartner  
- managingPartner  
- partner  
- president  
- executiveVicePresident  
- vicePresident  
- treasurer  
- comptroller  
- managingDirector  
- chairmanOfTheBoardOfDirectors

For other members of a business that are not the control person, the designation can be set to any of the full list of designation values:

- chiefExecutiveOfficer  
- chiefFinancialOfficer  
- chiefOperatingOfficer
