Depending on the use case, a wide range of controls can be set not just at the Client level but also at the Master and Sub Account levels, each in full adherence to the bank's risk and compliance standards.

Here are some examples of controls:
- Types of Sub Accounts that need to be enabled
- Whether Sub Accounts should be issued an Account Number
- How many Sub Accounts a FinTech can create under a Master Account
- Multiple kill switches at the Master and Sub Account levels

Account controls are set during the onboarding process.
