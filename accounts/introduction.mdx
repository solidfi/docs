An account is a resource with a built-in ledger that allows you to transfer money in and out. An account starts with a $0 balance. You need an account to:
- Deposit funds
- Make payments
- Issue a card

There are two types of accounts:

1. Master Account: The Master Account, which mirrors the FBO set up at the bank for FinTech, can only be provisioned after the Master Account Holder is created.	
For more, see the [Master Accounts Guide](/accounts/master-accounts).

2. Sub Account: Sub Accounts are created under a Master Account and can be created after the Sub Account Holder is created.
For more, see the [Sub Accounts Guide](/accounts/sub-accounts).
