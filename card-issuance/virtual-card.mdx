Solid offers its clients a fully managed card-art program. That means Solid manages the virtual card approval with the issuing bank and the network.

You can download the virtual cart art template's Figma file [here](https://www.figma.com/file/cwxnEXJtFIalnq96UCefSj/Card-Art-Template?node-id=0%3A1).

You must follow the Front of Card (FOC) design to simplify the process and get the required approval.

When customizing a card for your card program, you can display a horizontal or vertical virtual card, allowing for creative design choices.

Unlike a Physical Card that has both Front of Card (FOC) and Back of Card (BOC) designs, Virtual Card has only Front of Card (FOC).
