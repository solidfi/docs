You can use Solid card issuance to issue and manage cards for your card program â€“ prepaid, debit, or credit, for both consumers and businesses. 

Solid fully supports every detail of your card program, from card art to issuing cards programmatically (or via Dashboard) to managing the lifecycle of a card transaction.

You can issue cards to cardholders and link the card to the sub-accounts. You can also set up granular controls and authorize or decline transactions in real-time.
