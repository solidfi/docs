Solid offers its clients a fully managed card-art program. That means Solid manages the physical card approval with the issuing bank, network, and card printer.

### 1. Card Art ###

Solid has put together simple templates & guidelines for the card program to follow for the Front of Card (FOC) design to simplify the process and get the required approval.

When customizing a card for your card program, you have the option to choose between a horizontal or a vertical card. All our cards are Dual Interface (DI), which means they have a single embedded chip. This unique feature allows the card to be used in both contact and contactless transactions, providing flexibility and convenience to your users.

The instructions below explain the Front of Card (FOC) and Back of Card (BOC) template and the customization available to meet your brand guidelines.

<Note>Depending on the card's visual design (dark or light), Solid will setup the correct Visa logo (Blue, White or Black). Logo needs to contrast the card design (background).</Note>

You can download the cart art template's Figma file [here](https://www.figma.com/file/cwxnEXJtFIalnq96UCefSj/Card-Art-Template?node-id=0%3A1). Then, you can customize your card art using the Figma app or your web browser, export it to an SVG file, and send it back to Solid. Alternatively, you can send back your .fig file.

For physical cards, the printer will ultimately use EPS format with CMYK colors (Solid handles the formatting), so ideally, you would proof your colors in a design program such as Adobe Illustrator and export an EPS file from there.

### 2. Mailer Art ###

Solid manages the production of the physical card mailer with the card printer. The mailer is a 5x7 inch bi-fold greeting card style. See mock-ups below.
