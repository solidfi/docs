description: Part of the Contact Object, the Intrabank sub-object contains the account number or account ID of a linked account that also resides on the Solid platform.

When [creating an intrabank contact](https://www.solidfi.com/docs/create-a-contact), you can pass either the accountId or accountNumber to link the account.

| Field         | Type   | Description                             |
|---------------|--------|-----------------------------------------|
| accountNumber | string | account number of the intrabank contact |
| accountId     | string | account ID of the intrabank contact     |

Note that contacts have the three possible types in  [the Contact Object](https://www.solidfi.com/docs/the-contact-object): others, selfAch, and selfIntrabank.

If the user is linking intrabank accounts owned by the same entity, this is referred to as a selfIntrabank contact.

In this situation, they should create a separate contact for the selfIntrabank link using only the intrabank sub-object.

If users try to include a self-owned intrabank account when creating a standard others contact, they receive an error such as "EC_CONTACT_INVALID_SELF_INTRABANK_REQUEST" and "Invalid self intrabank request". They should remove the intrabank sub-object and create a separate contact for the selfIntrabank link.
