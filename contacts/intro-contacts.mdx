A Contact is the counter-party on the other side of a financial transaction, such as a person or a business.

Using the contact ID, you can:  
- [send money](https://www.solidfi.com/docs/introduction-to-send) (push) to a contact  
- [receive money](https://www.solidfi.com/docs/introduction-to-receive) (pull) from a contact  
- manage a list of all the contacts tied to an [account](https://www.solidfi.com/docs/introduction-to-accounts)  
- contacts can be reused for multiple transfer types so they only need to be created once
