You can test [Receive an ACH Pull](https://www.solidfi.com/docs/receive-an-ach-pull) in Solid's TEST mode without moving real money. You will first need to [Create a Contact](https://www.solidfi.com/docs/create-a-contact) to store the account and routing numbers from which you are going to pull the transfer. The contact will also need to have a valid bank routing number. Here are some examples:

Sample ACH Routing Numbers:  
- 121042882 (Wells Fargo)  
- 026009593 (Bank of America)  
- 322271627 (Chase)


```url ENDPOINT
POST /v1/receive/ach
```

```json REQUEST
{
    "accountId": "<em>{{accountId}}</em>",
    "contactId": "<em>{{contactId}}</em>",
    "amount": "20.00",
    "description": "Fund Account",
    "type": "sameDay"
}
```
Test values in amount field will have the following results, executed hourly:

Day 1 Batch Simulation after ACH Request:  
- Amount >=$100 is Rejected  
- Amount < $100 goes to Day 2  

Day 2 Batch Simulation after ACH Request:  
- Amount ≥ $50 Rejected as NSF (Insufficient Funds)  
- Account Number = 9999999999 Rejected as ANF (Account not Found)  
- If not rejected that means it is approved.
