You can test [Send an ACH Push](https://www.solidfi.com/docs/send-an-ach-push) in Solid's TEST mode without moving real money. You will first need to [Create a Contact](https://www.solidfi.com/docs/create-a-contact) to store the account and routing numbers to which you are going to send the transfer. The contact will also need to have a valid bank routing number. Here are some examples:

Sample ACH Routing Numbers:
- 121042882 (Wells Fargo)
- 026009593 (Bank of America)
- 322271627 (Chase)

```url ENDPOINT
POST /v1/send/ach
```

 
```json REQUEST
{
    "accountId": "<em>{{accountId}}</em>",
    "contactId": "<em>{{contactId}}</em>",
    "amount": "500.00",
    "description": "Rent Payment",
    "type": "sameDay"
}
```

Test values in amount field will have the following results, executed hourly:

- Transfers less than the account's available balance will succeed
- If Amount == $99.99, we create a reversal for this ACH RDFI ANF (Account Not Found)
- If Amount â‰¥ $1100 we create a reversal for the ACH (non-ANF)
