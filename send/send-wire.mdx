You can test [Send a Wire Transfer](https://www.solidfi.com/docs/send-a-wire-transfer) in Solid's TEST mode without moving real money. You will first need to [Create a Contact](https://www.solidfi.com/docs/create-a-contact) to store the account and routing numbers to which you are going to send the transfer.

For Domestic Wire, contact will also need to have a valid bank routing number. Here are some samples:  
- 121000248 (Wells Fargo)  
- 026009593 (Bank of America)  
- 021000021 (Chase)

For International Wire, contact will also need to have a valid SWIFT/BIC code. Here are some samples:  
- HBUKGB4BXXX (HSBC UK BANK PLC)  
- BNPAFRPHXXX (BNP PARIBAS)  
- ICICINBBXXX (ICICI BANK LIMITED)
