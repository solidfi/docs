For ease of development, Solid FinTech Platform offers you two modes:

**TEST**: Test credentials are real-life-like data but not actual data. Requests made to the TEST environment will never hit banking, payments, or identity verification networks. These will never affect live data.

**LIVE**: Real credentials and real data. Requests made to the LIVE environment will hit LIVE environments of banking or payments or identity verification networks. These will produce real data. For penny testing, you should use the LIVE environment.

You can use the TEST mode to build, test, and certify your FinTech integration before your program is switched to the LIVE mode. TEST Mode uses real phone numbers but provides you with test values to trigger different flows as you build and verify.
