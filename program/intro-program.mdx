description: The Program APIs allow you to configure your program and retrieve program-wide data
---
When you create an account on the Dashboard, you are essentially creating a FinTech program that comes with a program ID. You get a program id both in the TEST and LIVE mode. You can have one or more FinTech programs on the Solid Platform.

You can use the Program object to configure branding and settings for your program, and you can use the Program List APIs to a large variety of data belonging to your program.

This section contains the following documentation:
