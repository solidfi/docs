description: Information related to Solidâ€™s Real-Time Authorization RTA for outgoing ACH pulls
---
ACH RTA (Real Time Authorization) can be set and enabled in the developer section of the dashboard. The ACH RTA webhook event ach.auth.request is sent on any ACH authorization request. When enabled, the receiver must respond within 2 seconds with an approved or declined response. If the call times out or responds with a non-2xx status code, then stand-in processing rules will apply based on the RTA setup.

All RTA webhook requests are signed with a sd-webhook-sha256-signature header. The secret key is available in the dashboard in the Developer > Real Time Authorization section.
