Solid uses status response codes to indicate the status of a transfer. Please note this is the status of the transfer sub-object only. For status codes of the whole transaction object, [see this doc](http://www.solidfi.com/docs/transaction-status-codes). Here is a list of potential transfer status codes and the transaction types they're associated with.
