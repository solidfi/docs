Automated Clearing House (ACH) payment is a Push & Pull payment method supported by the Solid platform. An ACH payment occurs when the transaction originator instructs the ACH network to push money to or pull money from an external bank in the US. Unlike Intra Account transactions, ACH transactions go through multiple states in their lifecycle before the transaction finally settles:
- Originated: when an ACH transaction is created.
- Pending: when a transaction is waiting to be sent to the bank.
- Clearing: when a transaction has been sent to the bank in the NACHA file.
- Cleared: when the bank has processed the transaction and given Solid the production trace number. The trace number is a unique number used to locate the transaction if required.
- Settled: when a transaction is marked as settled to indicate the completion of the ACH transaction.
- Returned: When the originating ACH transaction is returned by the RDFI.

While ACH transactions can be somewhat complex, understanding the possible types of ACH transactions is essential. See examples below on originating outgoing (push/pull) and receiving incoming (push/pull) ACH transactions.

Sub Account Holder 1 at Partner Bank A wants to send $100 via ACH to Person 2 at Bank B. In this example, Sub Account Holder 1 is originating the ACH transaction at Partner Bank A, instructing the bank (via Solid's technology) to:
Debit $100 from Sub Account Holder 1's Sub Account at Partner Bank A
Credit $100 to Person 2's Account at Bank B
Message: Outgoing
Method: ACH
Type: Push
ODFI (Originating Depository Financial Institution): Partner Bank A

Example 1b: Originate ACH Pull
