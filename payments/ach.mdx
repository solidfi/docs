Automated Clearing House (ACH) payment is a Push & Pull payment method supported by the Solid platform. An ACH payment occurs when the transaction originator instructs the ACH network to push money to or pull money from an external bank in the US. Unlike Intra Account transactions, ACH transactions go through multiple states in their lifecycle before the transaction finally settles:
- Originated: when an ACH transaction is created.
- Pending: when a transaction is waiting to be sent to the bank.
- Clearing: when a transaction has been sent to the bank in the NACHA file.
- Cleared: when the bank has processed the transaction and given Solid the production trace number. The trace number is a unique number used to locate the transaction if required.
- Settled: when a transaction is marked as settled to indicate the completion of the ACH transaction.
- Returned: When the originating ACH transaction is returned by the RDFI.

While ACH transactions can be somewhat complex, understanding the possible types of ACH transactions is essential. See examples below on originating outgoing (push/pull) and receiving incoming (push/pull) ACH transactions.
