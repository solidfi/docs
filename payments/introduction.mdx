You can use Solid's payments stack to move money in and out of a Sub Account.

If money is moved out of a Sub Account, it results in a Debit Transaction.
If money is moved into a Sub Account, it results in a Credit Transaction.

Any money movement transaction (a credit or a debit) from in and out of the Sub Account creates a Transaction object. 

Solid provides you with various payment methods to move money in and out of the Sub Account:
- [Intra Account (On-us)](/payments/intra-account)
- [ACH](/payments/ach)
- [WireCheck](/payments/wire)
- [Check](/payments/check)
- FedNow (coming soon)

Solid provides you with status through the lifecycle of each payment transaction (available in the Transaction object): 
- Originated
- Pending
- Clearing
- Cleared
- Settled
- Canceled
- In Review
- Returned
- Reversed
- Received
- Declined
- Refunded

**Originating Transactions** (with an Outgoing message): Transactions originated from the Sub Account with an Outgoing message, which includes important instructions such as amount, credit/debit, method, and type. Transactions are originated via Payment APIs.

<Tip>Note that payments can only originate from a Sub Account, not from a Master Account.</Tip>

**Receiving Transactions** (with an Incoming message): Transactions received in the Sub Account with an Incoming message, which includes important instructions such as amount, credit/debit, method, and type. Transactions are received via Payment webhooks.

Every transaction is ledgered in both the Master Account and the Sub Account (that originated or received the transaction).
