Wires are direct transfers between banks. International wires (and in some cases, domestic wires) usually have intermediary/correspondent banks, which serve as third-party banks that help process and settle transactions. Unlike Intra Account transactions, Wire transactions go through multiple states in their lifecycle before the transaction finally settles:
- Originated: when a transaction is created.
- Pending: when a transaction is waiting to be sent to the bank.
- Clearing: when a transaction has been sent to the bank in the FedWire/MT103 file or via an API. 
- Cleared: when the bank has processed the transaction and given Solid the IMAD/OMAD number. The IMAD/OMAD number is a unique number used to locate the transaction if required. 
- Settled: when a transaction is marked as settled to indicate the completion of the wire transaction.
- Returned: when the originated wire transaction is returned by the RDFI.
